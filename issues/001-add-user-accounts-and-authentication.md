# Add user accounts and authentication

Add user registration and login (email/password), and session or token-based authentication (JWT or similar). Store users with profile fields (name, grade, avatar). Update the frontend to support sign-in, sign-out, and profile pages.

Acceptance criteria:
- Users can register and log in (password hashing).
- Authenticated endpoints accept and validate tokens/sessions.
- Profiles store name, grade, and optional avatar.
- Frontend sign-in UI and profile page scaffolded.
